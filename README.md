# Analytical Platform for eCommerce Store Using AWS

## Business Overview
Ecommerce analytics involves gathering data from various sources that influence an online store. This data is used to analyze customer behavior and online shopping trends, covering the entire customer journeyâ€”from discovery and acquisition to conversion, retention, and support.

This project simulates an eCommerce dataset to model user activity, including purchases, product views, cart history, and journey logs. The goal is to build **two analytical pipelines**: **Batch Processing** and **Real-Time Processing**. 

### **Batch Processing**  
Leverages AWS services to ingest, process, and visualize data, enabling insights such as:  
- **Unique visitors per day**  
- **Abandoned carts**: When users add products to carts but do not complete purchases  
- **Top categories by hour or weekday**: To promote discounts based on trends  
- **Marketing recommendations**: Identifying underperforming brands needing more promotion  

### **Real-Time Processing**  
Focuses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and bot attacks in real-time using AWS services.
